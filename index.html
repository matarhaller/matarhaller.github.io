    I am the Director of Algorithmic AI at <a href="http://www.sparkbeyond.com/">SparkBeyond</a>, where we are revolutionizing data science by building an
        automated research engine to solve the world's most impactful problems. The work we do here is engaging, exciting and tough,
        and I am especially grateful for the people I get to do it with.</p>
        
    <p class="lead">
        Prior to SparkBeyond, I was a data scientist at <a href="http://www.winton.com">Winton Capital</a>,
        where I discovered signals in nontraditional datasets.
        I was also a fellow at <a href="http://www.insightdatascience.com"> Insight Data Science</a> where I engineered an algorithm for
        <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491976166/video301092.html">automatic speech segmentation</a>
        from audio streams.</p>

    <p class="lead">I completed my PhD in <a href="http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Robert Knight's laboratory</a>
    at the <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>
    at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>, where I studied
    the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0267-2">link between perception and action</a> by recording activity from electrodes surgically placed on the
    surface of human brains. I also developed an <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/299859v1">algorithm for decomposing power spectra</a>.

    <p class="lead">Before my PhD, I was a preschool teacher and a tank instructor (not at the same time!)
    I am passionate about expanding leadership opportunities for women in STEM fields and
    am a mother to three wonderful children who surprise and inspire me every day.</p>
