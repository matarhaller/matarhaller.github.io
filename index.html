    I am the VP Data & AI at <a href="http://www.activefence.com/">ActiveFence</a>, where my teams own the end-to-end automated detection of harmful content 
        at scale, regardless of the abuse area or media type. The <a href="http://engineering.activefence.com/">work we do here</a> is 
        engaging, impactful and tough, and I am grateful for the people I get to do it with.</p>
        
    <p class="lead">
        Prior to ActiveFence, I was a the Director of Algorithmic AI at <a href="http://www.sparkbeyond.com/">SparkBeyond</a>,
        where we built an automated research engine to revolutionize data science. I was also a data scientist at <a href="http://www.winton.com">Winton Captital</a> and a fellow at <a href="http://www.insightdatascience.com">Insight Data Science</a>, 
        where I engineered an algorithm for <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491976166/video301092.html">automatic speech segmentation</a>
        from audio streams.</p>

    <p class="lead">I completed my PhD in <a href="http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Robert Knight's laboratory</a>
    at the <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>
    at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>, where I studied
    the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0267-2">link between perception and action</a> by recording activity from electrodes surgically placed on the
    surface of human brains. I also developed an <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/299859v1">algorithm for decomposing power spectra</a>.

    <p class="lead">Before my PhD, I was a preschool teacher and a tank instructor (not at the same time!).
    I am passionate about expanding leadership opportunities for women in STEM fields and together with my husband am
    raising three wonderful children who surprise and inspire us every day.</p>
